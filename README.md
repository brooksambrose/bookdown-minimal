Minimal examples for Stackoverflow question [How do I control (PART) numbering in gitbook TOC?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43688902/how-do-i-control-part-numbering-in-gitbook-toc)

Here are some iterations of currently supported heading syntaxes and how they render the toc in a gitbook.

### Would be nice if this worked:

### Correct Scene numbers but incorrect Part numbers:

### This doesn't help differentiate the Parts from the Scenes.

### This would make sense if it worked
